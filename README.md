# Camera Recommender

A site for helping folks find the right film camera for them!

Many film cameras on the secondhand market were made and used decades ago, which means that picking the right one requres many hours of research and lots of trial and error. Having experienced all of that myself, I've decided to make a site that recommends cameras based on user preferences. Happy buying!
